# What is Openstack?
![Openstack](Images/OpenStack.png)

* Openstack is a stack of services.

* These services correspond to the private cloud services.

* In various versions of Openstack, there is difference in number of services. Therefore according to the requirement select the version of Openstack which you want to install.

* Openstack is a open-source software which has a very large community to support, and that is the reason why Openstack is keep on evolving.

* The benefit of using Openstack cloud is that it provides you the code of the services present in it, & they can be customized according to the requirement! This feature is not available in any other public cloud like AWS, GCP, BlueOcean etc.

# Some use case of Private Cloud!

* If there is a requirement to store the dataset which is very critical, then private cloud is required, as we cannot take risk of storing that data in the public cloud!

* If there are various compliance in various companies, then private cloud is required.

* If we want to learn the services in depth then private cloud is the only option, because none of the public cloud provides their software, they only provides services.
